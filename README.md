## What is TMDB?

[The Movies DataBase(TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) is company that provides information on movies, TV shows, and celebrities. It's a community-driven platform where users can add and update content.

This is version 3 of TMDB API, where you will find the definitive list of currently available methods for our movie, tv, actor and image API.

## Process of Documenting

1. [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/32923208/2sAYdcrCA3) was used to test and documen all the endpoints.
2. This API was exported and converted using [Kevin Swiber](https://kevinswiber.github.io/postman2openapi/)
3. The [openAPI](https://github.com/Ileolami/docs/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.yaml) was edited with [Swagger editor](https://editor-next.swagger.io/)
4. Finally, integrated into Mintlify for interactiveness.

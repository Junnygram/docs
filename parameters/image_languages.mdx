title: Include Image Language

## Image Types
- `poster_path`: The `poster_path` is first searched in the language you specify in your query. 
If matching image is presented, it defaults to the highest-rated image in the media's original language. 
If that image is also unavailable, it falls back to the highest-rated image overall. 
<Note>
while the language query parameter supports regional lookups, <b>regional variants for images are not yet supported</b>â€”this feature will be added in the future.
</Note>

- `backdrop_path`: Since 99% of backdrops don't contain a language, the default lookup for a backdrop is to simply query for the highest rated backdrop with no language. If it doesn't exist, then we return the overall highest rated.

- `still_path`: Like backdrops, TV episode images don't inherently have languages. We query for the highest rated.

## Default Language
<Note>
When querying one of the `/images` methods, the `language` parameter filters the results based on the specified language. 
However, since you may want to retrieve images in multiple languages, it's recommended to use the `include_image_language` query parameter. 
This acts as a fallback, allowing you to include images tagged with additional languages or those without any language tag.

Below is an example of how to request images tagged with English (`en`) while also including images that have no language tag.
</Note>

```shell Example getting English and no language images
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550/images?language=en-US&include_image_language=en,null' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```
Notice the `include_image_language` parameter.
The query (`en,null`) retrieves all images tagged with English (`en`) as well as those without a language tag (null).

Even better, you can use this query parameter `append_to_response` to fetch an image in a single request, e.g:
```shell Example with append to response
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?append_to_response=images&language=en-US&include_image_language=en,null' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

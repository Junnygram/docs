A common workflow on TMDB involves searching for a movie (or TV show, or person) and then retrieving its details.

Here’s a quick overview of how that process works:
## 1. Search

To begin, you’ll query for a movie, TV show, or person using the [search](/api-reference/search) methods. 

We’ll use `Jack Reacher` and the movie endpoint for this example:

```shell Example Search Request
curl --request GET \
    --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query=Jack+Reacher' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
```

This request returns an object, but the key you’ll want to focus on is the `results` array. 

The `results` array contains standard movie list objects. Here’s an example of the first item:

```shell Example Results Object
"results": [
    {
        "adult": false,
        "backdrop_path": "/2v3pC01rf0uXnECOM94pjfqk1TY.jpg",
        "genre_ids": [
            80,
            18,
            53,
            28
        ],
        "id": 75780,
        "original_language": "en",
        "original_title": "Jack Reacher",
        "overview": "One morning in an ordinary town, five people are shot dead in a seemingly random attack. All evidence points to a single suspect: an ex-military sniper who is quickly brought into custody. The interrogation yields one written note: 'Get Jack Reacher!'. Reacher, an enigmatic ex-Army investigator, believes the authorities have the right man but agrees to help the sniper's defense attorney. However, the more Reacher delves into the case, the less clear-cut it appears. So begins an extraordinary chase for the truth, pitting Jack Reacher against an unexpected enemy, with a skill for violence and a secret to keep.",
        "popularity": 40.197,
        "poster_path": "/gLv55839pz4lhyKGRaJKbty41yq.jpg",
        "release_date": "2012-12-20",
        "title": "Jack Reacher",
        "video": false,
        "vote_average": 6.6,
        "vote_count": 7086
    }
]
```

## 2. Query for Movie Details

With the item above in hand, you can see an `id: 75780` this represent a movie ID. You can use this `id` to fetch for the movie detail like this:

```shell Example Details Query
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/75780' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
```

This request returns all the main movie detail, as outlined in the movie details documentation. 

For more efficiency, check out the [append to response](/parameters/append-response) feature, which allows you to make multiple sub-requests in one. For example, to get videos along with movie details:

```shell Example Append Request
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/75780?append_to_response=videos' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
```

This helps streamline your queries and reduce the number of API calls.

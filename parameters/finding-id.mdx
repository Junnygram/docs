There are 3 ways to search for and find movies, TV shows and people on TMDB. They're outlined below.

- [/search](/api-reference/search/movies) - Text based search is the most common way. 
You provide a query string and we provide the closest match. 
Searching by text takes into account all original, translated, alternative names and titles.
- [/discover](/api-reference/discover/movies) - this is useful for searching for movies and TV shows based on filters or definable values like ratings, certifications or release dates. 
- [/find](/api-reference/find/find-by-id) - The last but still very useful way to find data is with existing external IDs. 
For example, if you know the IMDB ID of a movie, TV show or person, you can plug that value into this method and we'll return anything that matches. 
This can be very useful when you have an existing tool and are adding our service to the mix.

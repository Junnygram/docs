You can authenticate TMDB users within your application to extend the TMDB experience within your application. 
This will let your users (nay—our users) do things like rate movies, maintain their favourite and watch lists as well as do things like create and edit custom lists—all while staying in sync with their account on TMDB.

Sub-Users authentication is controlled with a `session_id` query parameter. 
You can generate a `session_id` by following the steps outlined here.

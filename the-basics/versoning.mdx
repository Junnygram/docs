TMDB offers two version of her API: which are version 3 and 4. 

## [Version 3](/the-basics/introduction)
- Stability and Coverage: v3 is the stable and widely-used version, providing comprehensive access to TMDB's core features, including data on movies, TV shows, actors, and images.
- Authentication: Utilizes an `ACCESS_TOKEN` or as a `Bearer token` to authorize users.
- Session ID: To generate a session id, you will need a `request token`.

```shell Version 3 base url

```

## [Version 4](/version-4/documentation/getting)
- Enhanced Features: Introduces **improvements** over v3, notably the enhanced "lists" feature, allowing for more complex and user-specific lists. 
- Authentication: Requires a `ACCESS_TOKEN` in the `Authorization` header. This token provides a unified authentication method across both v3 and v4, simplifying the process.
- Session ID: To generate a session id, you will need a `request token` and `access token`.

## Key Differences:
- Lists Functionality: v4 offers a more advanced and flexible lists system compared to v3. If your application heavily relies on creating or managing lists, v4 is recommended. 
- Authentication Method: While v3 allows for API key authentication via query parameters, v4 mandates the use of a Bearer token.

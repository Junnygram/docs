<h2>[Migration Complete](https://developer.themoviedb.org/changelog/migration-complete)</h2>
  
  Thanks for being patient as I worked through getting our docs migrated to ReadMe. At this point I believe every method has been added and is present here. Iâ€™ll be cleaning up some of the links and copy over the next little while but everything is looking good and is representative of our API.

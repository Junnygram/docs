Application-level authentication is the default way to authenticate with the API. 
Version 4 uses your v4 `access token` as a `Bearer token`. 
You can request an API key by logging into your TMDB account and clicking [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

## Bearer Token
In your account page, under the API settings section, 
you will find a token called API Read Access Token. 
This token should be sent as an `Authorization` header. 
Here is a simple cURL example:

```shell
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.themoviedb.org/4/list/1 \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}'
```

Using the Bearer token allows for a single authentication process across both v3 and v4 API versions. Both versions provide the same level of access, so you can choose either one.

For `GET` requests on v4, you can still use your v3 `api_key` query parameter if you prefer.
